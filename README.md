# Self-Driving-Car
My versions of self driving cars simulation in python!

Credit to NeuralNine (Florian Dedov) for idea and some code (calculation of sensors and corners) for the program!

According to my knowledge, my algorithm is very similar to the NEAT algorithm, where it applies process of natural selection to neural networks.

Cars:

Blue car: cars with age of at least 5, drawn by me!

Green car: cars with age between 1 and 5

White car: new born cars (age of 0)



Python version: wrote in python 3.10, but also have tested that it works for python 3.9.
